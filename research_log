What's done:
run_cz_hmm_mle.r 
Proves that with a small group of people, the mle works well to cluster 
The trick is large population + few cliques 

Need to do: 
1, R HMM package is shit 
2, Python BW algorithm works better than R HMM
3, Design simulation test for both MLE and BW 
	MLE test: 	
	 	1, number of chains 
	 	2, soft_diff 
	 	3, num_ind / K 

	BW test: 
		1, length of seq 
		2, init A and B 
		3, num_ind / K 
		4, debug viterbi
